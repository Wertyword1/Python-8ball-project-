# Python-8ball-project-

Just a fun little project I created to test the new functions and techniques I learned. 
In this project you ask the Magic 8 Ball a question, and using its magical powers the Magic 8 Ball provides an answer.

Uses if and elif statements as well as the random module in order to generate a random number everytime the code is run. Important to note that the random numbers generated from this random module are actually pseudo-random and therefore technically do not qualify as actual randomly generated numbers.
